# sdt-diffusion-analysis
COGS 107 - Final project

This project uses a hierarchical Signal Detection Theory (SDT) model and delta plot-based diffusion model analysis on a 2×2×2 choice response time dataset. The goal is to compare the effects of Trial Difficulty (Easy vs Hard) and Stimulus Type (Simple vs Complex) on participants' performance using both accuracy-based and RT-based models.

Results:
- SDT Analysis: difficulty influenced discriminability. Easy trials had higher values than Hard trials. The stimulus type has minimal influence
- Delta Plots: Response time was longer for hard trials, especially at higher percentiles. Stimulus Type again showed minimal influence
- The two models prove that trial difficult has a stronger effect than stimulus type
